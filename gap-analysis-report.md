# Gap Analysis Report: Bug Fixes in Script

Date: 24/10/2023

Report Prepared By: Amit Singh

# Current State (Baseline): 

The original script contains multiple issues and bugs that impact security, maintainability, and code quality.
Desired State (Future Goals):

The desired state is to have a clean, secure, and well-structured script that adheres to best practices.
Gap Analysis:

# Security Gap:

* Current State: The original script stores the email password directly in the code, which is a security risk.
* Desired State: The desired state is to use environment variables to store sensitive information securely.
* Gap: The gap between the current state and desired state is a potential security vulnerability.

# Middleware Order Gap:

* Current State: In the original script, the 'helmet' middleware is placed before defining the route for sending emails.
* Desired State: The desired state is to apply 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware after defining the email-sending route.
* Gap: The gap between the current state and desired state is an issue related to middleware order.

# Bug Fixes:

1. Security Bug Fix:

* Description: The hardcoded email password in the original script has been replaced with environment variables.
* Implementation: The email user and password are now loaded from environment variables.
* Result: Sensitive information is now stored securely.

2. Middleware Order Fix:

* Description: In the original script, the 'helmet' middleware was placed before defining the route for sending emails. In the fixed script, the 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware is applied after defining the email-sending route.
* Implementation: The 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware is now applied in the correct order.
* Result: Middleware order has been corrected.

# Conclusion:

The gap analysis report identifies two critical issues in the original script and provides a clear description of the bug fixes in the improved script. By addressing these issues, the script has been made more secure, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.
Recommendations:

Continue to follow best practices for security, code quality, and maintainability in all code development.
Consider using additional security and validation measures as per project requirements.
Next Steps:

Regularly review and update the script to ensure it remains secure and follows best practices.
Conduct code reviews to catch and fix issues early in the development process.
